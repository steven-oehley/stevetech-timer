 * that lands here is a *stale* session cookie: the proxy only tests that the
 * cookie exists, so an expired or revoked one sails past it and fails here
 * instead. Sending those users to a login button would strand anybody holding
 * one behind a manual click forever — they have a perfectly good host session,
 * so just spend it. start-signin's loop guard falls back to /timer/login if
 * the handshake still doesn't produce a usable session.

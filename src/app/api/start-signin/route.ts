 * Silent zone sign-in.
 *
 * The host owns identity, so somebody who already has a host session should
 * never be asked to sign in a second time just because this zone keeps its own
 * session. The proxy sends sessionless traffic here instead of to /login, and
 * this route starts the handshake server-side and 302s the browser at the host.
 * Both first-party clients are registered with `skipConsent`, so the whole
 * round trip is invisible — the user goes from the launcher to their timers.
 *
 * `sign-in/oauth2` is POST-only and writes the PKCE verifier and state on its
 * own response, so we call it and carry those Set-Cookie headers onto the
 * redirect. Rebuilding the authorize URL by hand would leave the verifier
 * unstored and every callback would fail `state_mismatch`.
